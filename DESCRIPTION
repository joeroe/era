Description: Provides a consistent vector representation of years with an 
    associated calendar era or time scale. It includes built-in definitions of 
    several time scales commonly used in archaeology, geology, and other 
    paleosciences (e.g. Common Era, Before Present, SI-prefixed *annus*) as well
    as support for arbitrary user-defined eras. Functions and type-stable 
    arithmetic with years and conversions between eras are also provided.
