Description: Provides a consistent representation of year-based time scales as a
    numeric vector with an associated 'era'. There are built-in era definitions
    for many year numbering systems used in contemporary and historic calendars 
    (e.g. Common Era, Islamic 'Hijri' years); year-based time scales used in 
    archaeology, astronomy, geology, and other palaeosciences (e.g. 
    Before Present, SI-prefixed 'annus'); and support for arbitrary user-defined
    eras. Years can converted from any one era to another using a generalised 
    transformation function. Methods are also provided for robust casting and 
    coercion between years and other numeric types, type-stable arithmetic with 
    years, and pretty-printing in tables.
