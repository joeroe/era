Description: Provides a consistent vector representation of years with an 
    associated calendar era or time scale. It includes built-in definitions of 
    many contemporary and historic calendars; time scales commonly used in
    archaeology, astronomy, geology, and other palaeosciences (e.g. Before 
    Present, SI-prefixed annus); and support for arbitrary user-defined eras. 
    Functions for converting between eras and for type-stable arithmetic with 
    years are also provided.
